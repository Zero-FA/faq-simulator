Managing your Apex Trader Funding account effectively involves understanding the billing structure, fees, and processes. This guide consolidates key information to help you navigate account setup, billing, and related questions seamlessly.

30-Day Billing Cycle: How It Works
At Apex Trader Funding, we operate on an automatic 30-day billing cycle for your account subscriptions. Here’s what you need to know:

Automatic Renewal:
Your account subscription renews automatically every 30 days from the date you make your payment for either an Evaluation Account or a Performance Account, where a monthly fee is selected.
The billing will continue as long as the account subscription is active, regardless of whether you pass or fail the account, until you choose to cancel. Please be aware that Performance Accounts will auto-cancel upon failure.
Account Status:
Evaluation Accounts: If your Evaluation Account fails, the account subscription remains active. You can continue with the same subscription to test again without interruption.
Performance Accounts: If your Performance Account fails, the account subscription is automatically canceled. You will need to create a new subscription to continue.
Balance Reset:
Balances for Evaluation Accounts are not reset monthly unless the account fails before the renewal date. If an account fails, the balance is reset automatically at no extra charge.
Account Subscription Management:
You can manage your account subscriptions directly through the Apex dashboard to prevent unnecessary renewals or interruptions.
Managing Subscriptions After Cancelation: If an account subscription is canceled, the account will remain active until the expiration date. To reactivate, you will need to start a new subscription. Visit this guide for help: Account Cancelation.
Accessing Real-Time Data After Account Failure: For Rithmic accounts, real-time data remains accessible for 7 days after an account fails. Tradovate accounts lose real-time access within 24 hours. To restore access to data, you can either purchase a reset or create a new subscription. For more details, visit: Failed Renewals
Fees and Charges: A Transparent Breakdown
At Apex Trader Funding, we provide a clear and structured fee system to help you manage your trading expenses effectively. Here's everything you need to know about the costs associated with your account subscriptions.

Initial Fees
The initial fee is determined by the plan you select. Each plan offers unique features tailored to different trading needs.
For detailed pricing and plan options, please visit the Apex Trader Funding website.
Monthly Fees
Your monthly account subscription fee grants full access to your Evaluation Account and includes the following benefits:

Performance Tracking: Monitor and evaluate your trading progress.
Real-Time Data Feed: Access live market data, as long as your account is active.
NinjaTrader Platform License Key: Trade seamlessly using one of the industry’s leading platforms.
No additional purchases are required to trade within your Evaluation Account, ensuring you have all the tools you need to get started.

Important Reminder:

Failed Evaluation Account Subscriptions: These accounts do not automatically cancel upon failure. If you no longer wish to continue, you must manually cancel the subscription to avoid further charges.

By understanding these fees and actively managing your subscriptions, you can focus on your trading journey without unexpected charges.

Renewal Billing: Everything You Need to Know
Managing your account subscription renewals with Apex Trader Funding is straightforward. Below are the key details and steps to ensure uninterrupted access to your accounts.

Billing Schedule
Billing occurs on the subscription start date and recurs every 30 days.
To check your next billing date, log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard, which displays all active subscriptions and renewal dates.
Separate invoices are generated for each paid or funded account subscription.


Balance and Drawdown
Balance and Drawdown
Your cash balance and drawdown carry forward each month unless your account is in a failed status.
Failed Accounts:
Accounts in a failed status are automatically reset at no extra cost during the renewal process.
To qualify for this reset, the Evaluation Account must fail before 5 PM ET on the trading day before the invoice renewal date. Otherwise, the account will not be reset, and balances will remain unchanged.
Renewal Issues
By staying informed about your renewal process and ensuring your payment details are updated, you can enjoy uninterrupted trading with Apex Trader Funding.

Payment Method: Ensure your credit card information is up to date to avoid disruptions in the renewal process.


Missed Invoices: If an invoice renewal fails, you can manually renew it by:
Logging into the Apex dashboard.
Navigating to the Payment History section.
Locating the failed invoice and clicking Manually Renew.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to: How to Manually Renew Your Account.
Credit Card Payments: A Comprehensive Guide
Managing your payments with Apex Trader Funding is simple and efficient. Follow these guidelines to ensure seamless transactions and uninterrupted account access.

Accepted Payment Methods
Apex Trader Funding accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Discover for all transactions.
Card Management
To update or change your card:
Log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard.
Click on the Update Credit Card link.
Follow the on-screen instructions to save your new card details.
Important Note: Any new purchase made using the CIM processor automatically updates the card on file for future billing.
Card Usage Rules
You must use your own card for all fees, resets, or PA account payments.
If your card is rejected, you must update it before the renewal date to retain balances and avoid interruptions.
Handling Declined Payments
Declined payments can occur due to various reasons, including bank restrictions or incorrect billing details. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

Error 609 (Transaction Blocked by Issuer):

This error typically indicates that your bank has flagged the transaction for security reasons.
What to Do:
Contact your bank directly to authorize the payment.
Confirm that your card can process online or international transactions if applicable.
Billing Information:

Ensure that the billing address and personal details entered match those associated with your card.
Retrying the Payment:

Once your bank has authorized the payment, retry the transaction through your Apex Dashboard. Ensure all details are accurate. Please visit this guide for more details: Renew Manually.
If the issue persists, update your payment method with a different card to avoid disruptions.

Avoiding Duplicate Payment Errors
This error occurs when a payment is retried too quickly after a failed attempt or when the same transaction is processed multiple times within a short time frame. To avoid this, wait a few minutes before attempting the payment again.

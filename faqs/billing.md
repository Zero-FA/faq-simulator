Managing your Apex Trader Funding account effectively involves understanding the billing structure, fees, and processes. This guide consolidates key information to help you navigate account setup, billing, and related questions seamlessly.

30-Day Billing Cycle: How It Works
At Apex Trader Funding, we operate on an automatic 30-day billing cycle for your account subscriptions. Here’s what you need to know:

Automatic Renewal:
Your account subscription renews automatically every 30 days from the date you make your payment for either an Evaluation Account or a Performance Account, where a monthly fee is selected.
The billing will continue as long as the account subscription is active, regardless of whether you pass or fail the account, until you choose to cancel. Please be aware that Performance Accounts will auto-cancel upon failure.
Account Status:
Evaluation Accounts: If your Evaluation Account fails, the account subscription remains active. You can continue with the same subscription to test again without interruption.
Performance Accounts: If your Performance Account fails, the account subscription is automatically canceled. You will need to create a new subscription to continue.
Balance Reset:
Balances for Evaluation Accounts are not reset monthly unless the account fails before the renewal date. If an account fails, the balance is reset automatically at no extra charge.
Account Subscription Management:
You can manage your account subscriptions directly through the Apex dashboard to prevent unnecessary renewals or interruptions.
Managing Subscriptions After Cancelation: If an account subscription is canceled, the account will remain active until the expiration date. To reactivate, you will need to start a new subscription. Visit this guide for help: Account Cancelation.
Accessing Real-Time Data After Account Failure: For Rithmic accounts, real-time data remains accessible for 7 days after an account fails. Tradovate accounts lose real-time access within 24 hours. To restore access to data, you can either purchase a reset or create a new subscription. For more details, visit: Failed Renewals
Fees and Charges: A Transparent Breakdown
At Apex Trader Funding, we provide a clear and structured fee system to help you manage your trading expenses effectively. Here's everything you need to know about the costs associated with your account subscriptions.

Initial Fees
The initial fee is determined by the plan you select. Each plan offers unique features tailored to different trading needs.

Monthly Fees
Your monthly account subscription fee grants full access to your Evaluation Account and includes the following benefits:

Performance Tracking: Monitor and evaluate your trading progress.
Real-Time Data Feed: Access live market data, as long as your account is active.

Billing Schedule

To check your next billing date, log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard, which displays all active subscriptions and renewal dates.
Separate invoices are generated for each paid or funded account subscription.


Balance and Drawdown
Balance and Drawdown
Your cash balance and drawdown carry forward each month unless your account is in a failed status.
Failed Accounts:
Accounts in a failed status are automatically reset at no extra cost during the renewal process.
To qualify for this reset, the Evaluation Account must fail before 5 PM ET on the trading day before the invoice renewal date. Otherwise, the account will not be reset, and balances will remain unchanged.
Renewal Issues
By staying informed about your renewal process and ensuring your payment details are updated, you can enjoy uninterrupted trading with Apex Trader Funding.

Payment Method: Ensure your credit card information is up to date to avoid disruptions in the renewal process.


Missed Invoices: If an invoice renewal fails, you can manually renew it by:
Logging into the Apex dashboard.
Navigating to the Payment History section.
Locating the failed invoice and clicking Manually Renew.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to: How to Manually Renew Your Account.
Credit Card Payments: A Comprehensive Guide
Managing your payments with Apex Trader Funding is simple and efficient. Follow these guidelines to ensure seamless transactions and uninterrupted account access.

Accepted Payment Methods
Apex Trader Funding accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Discover for all transactions.
Card Management
To update or change your card:
Log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard.
Click on the Update Credit Card link.
Follow the on-screen instructions to save your new card details.
Important Note: Any new purchase made using the CIM processor automatically updates the card on file for future billing.
Card Usage Rules
You must use your own card for all fees, resets, or PA account payments.
If your card is rejected, you must update it before the renewal date to retain balances and avoid interruptions.
Handling Declined Payments
Declined payments can occur due to various reasons, including bank restrictions or incorrect billing details. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

Error 609 (Transaction Blocked by Issuer):
This error typically indicates that your bank has flagged the transaction for security reasons.
What to Do:
Contact your bank directly to authorize the payment.
Confirm that your card can process online or international transactions if applicable.
Billing Information:

Ensure that the billing address and personal details entered match those associated with your card.
Retrying the Payment:

Once your bank has authorized the payment, retry the transaction through your Apex Dashboard. Ensure all details are accurate. Please visit this guide for more details: Renew Manually.
If the issue persists, update your payment method with a different card to avoid disruptions.

Avoiding Duplicate Payment Errors
This error occurs when a payment is retried too quickly after a failed attempt or when the same transaction is processed multiple times within a short time frame. To avoid this, wait a few minutes before attempting the payment again.

Reset Options and Invoice Cancellations
Not yet followed by anyone
In your trading journey, you might encounter situations where your evaluation account becomes inactive due to breaking a rule—such as reaching the maximum drawdown threshold. When this happens, an error message stating, “Trades Can Only Be Placed By Administrator,” may appear. If you wish to continue trading within your subscription period, you have the option to reset your account. This article provides detailed information on how to reset your evaluation account, our policies regarding resets, and important considerations to keep in mind.

Resetting Your Evaluation Account
When to Reset
If your evaluation account becomes inactive because you’ve broken a rule, you can choose to reset it. Resetting allows you to start fresh with a full balance, full trailing drawdown, and zero days traded. 

How to Reset
To reset your account:

Close All Positions: Before initiating a reset, ensure that all open positions are closed.
Purchase a Reset:
Log In: Access your members’ area here.
Select Account: Click on Reset next to the account you wish to reset.
Warning: Make sure you reset the correct account, as this action is irreversible.
Processing Time: The system typically processes resets within 10 minutes, but processing times may vary.

Important Notes on Resetting
Understanding how resets work is essential for managing your Apex Trader Funding accounts effectively. Below are the key guidelines and considerations to keep in mind when resetting an account:

Renewal Date Unchanged
Resets do not extend your renewal or expiration date.
Your renewal date remains exactly 30 days from the last billing date, regardless of resets.
Resetting a Canceled Evaluation Account
If your Evaluation Account was canceled but is still within the subscription period, it can be reset manually to restore its balance and parameters.
Resets do not reactivate canceled subscriptions or change renewal dates.
Important: If an Evaluation Account is canceled, it must be converted to a Performance Account (PA) within the 30-day rebill period. Once the rebill date passes, the account can no longer be converted to a PA.
Refund Policy
No Refunds: Reset fees are non-refundable, even if the reset was made by mistake.
Resetting Passed Accounts
DO NOT reset a passed account.
This action is irreversible, and you will permanently lose any progress made.
If you reset a passed account, you will need to start over with a fresh balance.
Impact of Resetting
A reset will restore:
Your drawdown.
Your initial balance.
Your accumulated trading days.
However, a reset does not change your renewal date.
Resetting The Same Account Multiple Times
If you reset an account (e.g., APEX-12345-12) and it generates a new account number (e.g., APEX-12345-13), then reset it again to APEX-12345-14 without taking any trades on account -13, you will not be eligible for a refund. This is considered a user error.
To Avoid Issues:
Always ensure you have traded and failed on the previous account (e.g., -13) before resetting.
Keep track of which accounts you have traded and failed to avoid resetting an unused account.
No Penalty for Resetting
You can reset your accounts as many times as needed without any penalties.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your resets while avoiding common mistakes. Always track your accounts carefully and ensure you’re adhering to these rules to avoid unnecessary complications.

Our Policy on Resets Upon Monthly Auto-Renewal
Apex Trader Funding's reset policy is designed to simplify the process for traders and minimize unnecessary fees. If your Evaluation Account fails and you forget to cancel your subscription, a free reset will be applied automatically upon renewal as part of the renewal fee, provided certain conditions are met. This guide explains the process and helps you manage resets effectively.

Conditions for Free Reset Upon Renewal
Account Status: To qualify for the free reset, the account must be in failed status as of the market close for the Trading Day prior to the renewal date (be mindful of CME Holidays and early market closes, these do not count as trading days unless otherwise specified by the CME here).
Successful Renewal Fee: The subscription renewal fee must be successfully charged. The free reset applies only when the renewal payment is processed.
Automatic Process: The reset will happen automatically after the renewal. No action is required on your part.
Options Before Renewal
If you don’t want to wait for the automatic reset, you have two alternatives:

Manual Reset: You can manually reset your account before the renewal date by paying the reset fee ($80 for Rithmic accounts / $100 for Tradovate accounts).
Cancel and Sign Up for a New Account: You can choose to cancel your current account subscription and sign up for a new one. This prevents you from being charged for both a renewal and a reset fee, especially if you wish to take advantage of any available discount promotions.
Important Considerations
No Retroactive Resets: If you reset your account manually before the renewal date and then it renews, you will not receive a refund for the reset fee.

Evaluation Accounts Only: This policy applies exclusively to Evaluation Accounts. Performance Accounts (PAs) are not eligible for auto-resets.

Subsequent Failures: If your account fails again after the reset, it will not be reset for free unless it renews while in a failed status.

Multiple Resets: Resets are only free upon renewal when the account is in a failed status. If you fail an active account and reset it, additional resets will require payment.

This policy is designed to assist traders who might forget to cancel their accounts and sign up for new ones with available discount promotions. By automatically resetting failed accounts upon renewal, traders avoid having to pay both a renewal fee and a reset fee.

Confirm your reset. This action will:
Restore your account balance.
Restart the seven trading days.
Maintain your billing cycle (does not change renewal date).
Caution: Ensure you select the correct account. Resets are irreversible.

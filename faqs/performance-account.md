##### Contract Scaling Rule

To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.
Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For 100K Static Accounts: Full contracts can be traded after reaching the safety net amount of $2,600.
For example, on a $50,000 Performance Account (PA) with a maximum of 10 contracts, traders can initially trade up to 5 contracts. When the account EOD balance reaches $52,600 ($50,000 initial balance + $2,500 trailing drawdown + $100 buffer), the trailing stop no longer applies, and traders can trade the full 10 contracts.
Once the trailing threshold is reached, traders can continue using the full contract limit even if the account balance drops below the threshold.
Single Violation Penalty: If more than half of the maximum allowed contracts are accidentally traded, traders are expected to close out the excessive contracts immediately. Failure to do so may result in the payout request being denied and the account being reset to the EOD balance from the previous trading day, which is the day before the first scaling rule violation occurred.
The trader would then need to complete 8 additional compliant trading days before becoming eligible to request another payout.
Consistent Violation Penalty: Blatant or repeated violations of the scaling rule will result in account closure and forfeiture of all balances.

##### 30% Negative P&L Rule - Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)

The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (P&L) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative P&L cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.
This is not a daily loss limit, but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your open negative P&L should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.
Limit on Losses: Open trades should not exceed a 30% negative drawdown from the account’s profit balance.
Example: For a $50,000 account, if the profit balance is $4,000, a trader should not allow a drawdown exceeding $1,200.
New/Low Profit Accounts: For accounts that are new or have low profits, the 30% rule is based on the trailing threshold (e.g., 30% of $2,500 on a $50,000 account would be $750).
Adjustment Based on Growth: If the end-of-day (EOD) profit balance doubles the safety net, traders may use a 50% drawdown limit instead of 30% starting with the next full trading session.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, if you accumulate $2,600 in profit and pass the safety net, your risk is calculated based on 30% of that $2,600. If your profits rise to $5,200, your drawdown allowance can increase to $2,600 (50% of $5,200).
At Apex Trader Funding, responsible trading is at the core of our practices, and managing drawdowns is a crucial part of that. Here’s what you need to know:
Continuous Monitoring: We encourage you to regularly monitor your trades and adjust your positions as needed to stay within these limits. If your drawdown approaches 30%, consider closing or adjusting your trades to avoid breaching the limit. Quick adjustments can help prevent any compliance issues.
Temporary Exceedances: If your drawdown momentarily exceeds 30% but you act quickly to manage the situation, there won’t be an automatic penalty. However, repeated or significant breaches could lead to warnings or account restrictions.
Adhering to these guidelines can ensure that your trading strategy remains robust and sustainable. These terms should be strictly followed to ensure consistent compliance with Apex's 30% negative P&L rule.
Static Accounts
The 30% Negative P&L rule for Static Accounts is designed to help manage risk by ensuring that losses are kept within safe limits. The rule applies in two stages: one when the account balance is below the safety net, and another when it exceeds the safety net.
Below the Safety Net ($2,600): When the account balance is below the $2,600 safety net, the maximum loss per trade is $187.50. This is 30% of the fixed $625 drawdown that applies to accounts at this stage. Essentially, until the balance surpasses the safety net, the rule restricts your loss on any single trade to $187.50.
Above the Safety Net ($2,600): Once the account balance exceeds $2,600, the 30% Negative P&L rule is recalculated based on the current profit balance in the account. For example, if your account reaches $103,000, which includes a $3,000 profit, the maximum allowable loss per trade is $900 (30% of the $3,000 profit).

##### 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule

The 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule is a risk management guideline that ensures your trades are balanced with a responsible amount of risk relative to the potential profit. For every trade you make, your stop loss should not exceed five times the amount of your profit target.
For example:
If your profit target is 10 ticks, your maximum stop loss should be 50 ticks (5 times your profit target).
If you set a stop loss beyond 50 ticks, such as 100 ticks, this would violate the rule.
Following the 5:1 rule helps you manage risk by ensuring that you are not taking excessive losses relative to your target profits. This helps protect your account balance and encourages more disciplined trading over time. It also promotes a strategy where your potential rewards are always greater than the risks you are taking on each trade. By following the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio, you maintain a disciplined trading approach that supports long-term success and helps you manage risk effectively.

##### Hedging and Correlated Instruments Rule

Traders shall not trade one direction on minis and another direction on micros at the same time. Traders shall not spread trade indices, i.e., long ES, and short YM. All Apex accounts must be traded directionally only and never be both long and short concurrently in the same account or in other accounts in any correlated markets. This includes all indices, metals, grains, currencies, or any correlating instrument, no matter the size, i.e., micro, mini, etc. For example, the trader cannot be short NQ and Long ES under any circumstance.

##### One-Direction Rule (Directionally biased trading)

Single Direction Rule: Traders are only allowed to hold a position in one direction at any time—either long (buy) or short (sell). Traders are also prohibited from using a non-directionally biased strategy where they have open orders for both sides of the market
No Hedging: Holding both long and short positions simultaneously on the same or correlated instrument is strictly prohibited. This rule ensures that trades are based on strategic analysis rather than speculative attempts to hedge both sides during a news-driven breakout.

##### Safety Net Requirement Rule

Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If you have reached the safety net threshold, you can request a payout of at least $500, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, the drawdown is $2,500, so the safety net is calculated as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.

##### Prohibited Activities

To maintain integrity and ensure funding is provided only to disciplined and consistent traders, Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits the following activities in Performance Accounts (PA):
Trading Without Stop Losses or Risk Management: All trades must have either pending or mental stop losses and a well-defined risk management strategy. Trading without these measures is strictly prohibited.
High-Risk Strategies: Strategies that involve small profit targets while risking disproportionately large amounts are not allowed. For example, setting a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss demonstrates unacceptable risk management.
Using the Trailing Threshold as a Stop Loss: Traders are prohibited from using the account's full threshold as a stop-loss mechanism to absorb large losses, leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling Evaluation Accounts: Purchasing multiple discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and intentionally "blow up" accounts in pursuit of windfall profits is not permitted.
Unsustainable Strategies: Any trading, risk management, or implementation that fails to demonstrate consistent growth and sustainability is prohibited. This includes schemes or behaviors that do not align with responsible trading practices.
Deviating from Professional Standards: Traders must employ strategies and risk management techniques consistent with those they would use in a personally funded account at a registered broker. Apex does not fund traders who deviate from this standard.
Manipulation of the simulated trading environment: Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits manipulation or exploitation of the simulation environment in any way including High Frequency Trading (HFT) or any other exploitative strategies.
Unauthorized Users: Allowing any individual other than the registered owner to access or perform account verification is strictly prohibited. Apex reserves the right to request additional information — including audits and verification procedures — from the account owner to ensure that only the authorized user is trading or accessing the account and to enforce compliance with the contract.
Account and Resource Sharing: Sharing MAC addresses, computers, IPs, credit cards, or trade copying with other traders is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in account closure, forfeiture of funds, and potential additional verification or audits to ensure compliance.
Multiple Account Creation: Creating multiple user accounts is prohibited and is a bannable offense. For more information, please see the following article: Apex Trader Funding Accounts.
Traders engaging in these prohibited activities will forfeit their accounts and all associated balances. Apex reserves the right to audit accounts further if there is a suspicion of non-compliance to guarantee adherence to the trader agreement.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can maintain their accounts in good standing and demonstrate the consistent, disciplined approach Apex seeks to fund.

##### PA General Questions & Billing Information

Navigating the landscape of paid and funded trading accounts can be complex, especially when managing multiple accounts across different platforms and entities. Apex Trader Funding provides a structured approach to managing these accounts, ensuring consistency and compliance. This article outlines the key policies and functionalities associated with Paid Accounts (PA) and Evaluation Accounts, helping traders maximize their potential while adhering to Apex Trader Funding’s guidelines.
PA Account Fees and Payment Options
At Apex, managing your Performance Account (PA) accounts is streamlined with clear fee structures and payment options designed to suit your trading needs. Whether you're a new trader or managing multiple accounts, it's essential to understand the lifetime and monthly fee options, activation procedures, and billing processes to make informed decisions. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of PA account fees, payment options, and essential procedures to ensure a smooth experience with Apex.
How the PA Account Process Works:
Pass the Evaluation Before the Renewal Date: To qualify for a refund of the evaluation renewal fee, you must pass your evaluation at least one day before the renewal date.
Activate the PA Account Within 48 Hours: Once you've passed the evaluation, you must activate your PA account within 48 hours. This includes signing the agreement and paying the PA fee.
If the renewal fee was paid before you passed the evaluation or activated the PA account, the renewal fee is unfortunately not eligible for a refund, as the system processes renewals automatically and requires both the evaluation to be passed and the PA account to be activated within the proper time frame.
What Happens After You Activate Your PA Account:
Once your PA account is activated, the following changes will occur:
Evaluation Account Cancelation: Your passed evaluation account will be automatically canceled, and any monthly evaluation fees associated with it will be waived.
Monthly PA Fees: Depending on the platform you choose, the monthly fees are:
Rithmic: $85 per month
Tradovate: $105 per month
Alternatively, you can choose a Lifetime PA Fee, which varies based on the account size. This one-time fee covers all future costs for non-professional traders.
NinjaTrader License: You’ll continue to have access to a free NinjaTrader License Key for the duration of your account.
For more detailed information about PA fees, billing, and payment options, visit: PA Fees.

Understanding Trading Days and System Updates
A trading day is defined from 6 PM ET one day to 4:59 PM ET the next day. The system updates overnight to recognize the previous completed trading day. For instance, after completing seven days of trading and passing the Evaluation, the system will acknowledge this on the morning of the eighth day, initiating the process to email you the paperwork for the PA Account.
Monitoring Your Progress:
PA Charts: Check your trading days and account statuses in your member's area under "PA Charts."
Updates: The PA Charts display statistics from the previous day and refresh every 24 hours to ensure you have the most current information. Watch the video below to see how you can utilize the information in the PA Charts.
What Happens if I Fail a Paid Performance Account?
At Apex, we understand that the journey to becoming a successful trader involves challenges, including the possibility of not meeting the requirements of a Funded or Paid Performance Account (PA). To support our traders through these setbacks, we have established clear policies and supportive measures to ensure that you can continue striving toward your trading goals without unnecessary burdens. This guide outlines what happens if you fail a Funded or PA account, the status of your NinjaTrader license key, and the steps you can take to restart your evaluation process with advantageous discounts.
Failing a Paid Performance (PA) Account at Apex triggers a specific set of procedures designed to maintain clarity and fairness for all traders. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what occurs and what actions you should take:
Automatic Subscription Cancelation 
Account Cancelation: If you fail a PA, the system will automatically cancel your account.
Recurring Fee Cancelation: The account and any recurring PA fees associated with it will also be canceled.
Verification: Log in to your member's area to ensure that the cancellation has been processed. Check that both the account and the PA fee have been successfully canceled to avoid any further charges.
Important Note: If you cancel your PA invoice, your account will be deactivated at the expiry date of the billing cycle. This is an irreversible action, and we cannot reactivate invoices that are canceled. Please move with caution when canceling account invoices. You should never need to cancel a PA invoice, as it is done automatically once the account breaches the drawdown.
Restarting the Evaluation Process
Begin Again: After confirming the cancellation, you can start the evaluation process anew. Sign up for another evaluation account to continue your path toward securing a PA. Note: Check your emails for the Breached PA email with an exclusive discount for a new evaluation.
No Restrictions on Attempts: Failing a PA does not prevent you from trying again. Unlike other companies that impose hefty reset fees ranging from $500 to $1,700, Apex offers more favorable terms to our members.
Exclusive Discounts for Restarting Evaluations
Apex is committed to supporting our traders by offering significant discounts to facilitate your continued evaluations:
Unique Discount Code: After failing a PA, you will receive an email containing a unique code.
Evaluation Discount: This code grants you an 80% discount for one month on an evaluation and 50% off for every subsequent recurring month.
One-Time Use: The discount applies to ONE evaluation on any account size.
Expiration: The coupon code must be used within seven (7) calendar days after the PA failure and cannot be reactivated once expired.
Email Timing: You should expect to receive the discount email sometime after 1:00 AM ET the day after your PA Account fails.
Unlimited Evaluation Resets
Flexible Attempts: You can reset and restart your evaluation accounts as many times as necessary to achieve success.
PA Account Limitations: While PA Accounts cannot be reset once failed, evaluation accounts remain flexible, allowing you to continuously work towards meeting the performance criteria.
Failed a Funded Account: What Happens to Your NinjaTrader License Key?
If you fail a Funded Account at Apex, it’s important to know that the NinjaTrader license key is not associated with specific accounts. Your user profile needs an active account/subscription to continue accessing the NinjaTrader License Key. If you fail your PA and have no other active accounts, then you will lose the license key, including the default NinjaTrader SIM Account. The license key is not a lifetime key; instead, it is tied directly to your member account. Here’s what you need to do if you have no other active accounts/subscriptions:
Restart the Evaluation Process: Upon failing a Funded Account, you must initiate a new evaluation account to regain access to your NinjaTrader license key.
Additional Support and Resources
To further assist you in navigating the process of restarting your evaluation and maximizing your chances of success, Apex provides additional resources:
Help Desk Assistance: If you encounter any issues or have questions about the cancelation process or discounts, our help desk is available to support you. However, please note that they cannot make exceptions to the established policies.
Reminders
No Lifetime License Keys: Remember that NinjaTrader license keys are tied to specific user accounts and are not transferable after account expiration.
Timely Use of Discounts: Utilize your unique discount code within the seven-day window to take advantage of significant savings on your next evaluation.
Continuous Effort: Persistence is key. Take advantage of the flexible evaluation resets to hone your trading skills and meet the necessary criteria for a successful PA Account.
Stay Informed: Regularly check your emails and the members’ area for updates, discount codes, and important notifications regarding your accounts.
By understanding and adhering to these procedures, you can effectively manage the challenges of failed Funded and PA Accounts at Apex. Our supportive policies and generous discounts are designed to help you overcome setbacks and continue your journey toward trading success with confidence and financial prudence.
PA Account Benefits and Guidelines
Allowed Number of Performance Accounts (PAs)
At Apex Trader Funding, traders are allowed to manage one Member Account and one Business Member Account, with a total of up to 20 Funded Performance Accounts (PAs) collectively under those accounts. Traders can also have multiple Evaluation Account subscriptions within the same Member Account to test and refine their strategies before transitioning to a funded account.
Account Structure Breakdown
One Member Account: Each trader is permitted to have one Member Account to manage their subscription accounts. This means one login is linked to a single email; it is not permitted to create multiple email logins for the Apex dashboard.
One Business Member Account: If applicable, you can also have one Business Member Account to manage Performance Accounts (PAs) and Evaluation Accounts under a business entity.
Performance Accounts (PAs): You can hold up to 20 PA accounts under a single Member or Business Member Account, collectively.
A total of 20 PA accounts within the same household.
Evaluation Accounts: Evaluation Accounts are unlimited, allowing traders to test and refine strategies before transitioning to a funded account. These do not count toward the 20 PA account limit.
Copy trading across PA accounts: It is permitted to copy trade across accounts in your personal name and business name. However, the hedging rule still applies; all PAs must trade in the same direction and not hedge against correlated assets.
Example Scenario for PA Accounts:
Member Account:
Rithmic PA Subscriptions: 3 PA accounts are held under the Member Account.
Tradovate PA Subscriptions: 4 PA accounts are held under the Member Account.
Business Member Account:
Rithmic PA Subscriptions: 5 PA accounts are held under the Business Member Account.
Spouse/Significant Other:
8 PA accounts are held under their own Member or Business Member Account.
In this scenario, the total number of PA accounts across both the Member Account, Business Member Account, and Spouse/Significant Other would be 20, which is the maximum allowed.
Important Notes:
Evaluation Accounts: These accounts are unlimited and are separate from the 20 PA account limit. You can use them to test strategies before applying for a funded account.
Adherence to Limits: Ensure that you don’t exceed 20 PA accounts across your Member Account, Business Member Account, and any accounts held by your Spouse/Significant Other residing within the same household. 
You CANNOT exceed a total of 20 active PA accounts.
If you have more than 20 PA accounts, you will be ineligible for payout and may be subject to:
forfeiture of all funds
closure of all performance accounts
permanent ban from Apex Trader Funding
There are no limits to Evaluation accounts.
By following these guidelines, you can scale your trading with multiple PA accounts, while still complying with Apex’s rules and maintaining account integrity.
Trading Guidelines
After you pass your evaluation and pay the PA activation fee (monthly or lifetime), you will receive a new PA account that matches your passed evaluation; this includes a fresh account balance corresponding to the starting balance of the passed evaluation. 
Trade Closure Requirement: Daily Trade Closure: All trades must be closed, and any pending orders must be canceled by 4:59 PM EST each day. This ensures that your account remains compliant with the trading rules.
For a more detailed understanding of the process and guidelines, refer to the PA Rules Article here.
Contract Size Limits in PA Accounts
Traders are encouraged to trade up to the maximum allowed contracts based on the limits of their Performance Account (PA), in accordance with the Contract Size Consistency Rule. However, increasing the number of contracts within a single PA account beyond the permitted maximum limit is not allowed.
If additional trading capacity is required, traders can open, pass, and activate a new evaluation account that aligns with the desired contract size limits. This allows for scaling trading activity while maintaining compliance with Apex’s contract size consistency rules.
It's important to note that all trades must remain consistent with your defined strategy. Any attempt to adjust contract sizes recklessly or without a strategic rationale, particularly to chase profits or use windfall strategies, will result in non-compliance with the consistency rules.
By following these rules, traders can scale their trading responsibly and effectively while maintaining integrity and compliance with Apex’s performance account policies.
Payout Limits and Withdrawal Policies
Apex Trader Funding implements specific payout limits to ensure proper risk management and consistent trading practices. These limits apply to approved payouts during the early stages of your trading journey:
Payouts One to Three: Traders must maintain a Safety Net. This safety net ensures that a buffer equal to the drawdown amount plus $100 remains in the account for the first three payouts.
Max Withdrawal: Payouts for the first three approved payouts are capped at a maximum amount to ensure proper risk management.
Payouts Four to Five: Traders are no longer required to maintain a Safety Net, however, the maximum withdrawal limit for these payouts continues to apply.
Sixth Payout and Beyond: Starting with the sixth approved payout, traders can withdraw 100% of their profits, regardless of whether this is achieved earlier than four months.
Live Prop Account Transition: If you transition to a Live Prop Account, you can begin withdrawals before reaching the sixth payout.
Existing PA Holders: Traders already at 100% or in their third month will not be impacted by these changes and can continue trading as per the existing rules.
Withdrawal Schedule
Frequency: Payouts can be requested and received every 8 complete trading days, provided the trader has earned a profit of at least $50 on 5 or more of those days. Once a payout request is submitted, the 8-day payout period starts over again from the submission date. 
If a payout is denied, the profits earned are not lost. The trader can continue to trade, and once they meet the required criteria again (e.g., profit of $50 on at least 5 trading days), they can reapply for a payout. The trader must simply continue to trade and align their performance with PA rules, improving their chances of qualifying for the next payout.
Profit Sharing: Traders retain 100% of the first $25,000 in profits and 90% of any profits earned above that threshold.
For more detailed information on the payout process and policies, refer to the Payout Policies.

##### Payout Method: US-Based Users

If you live in the United States, your payouts will be sent via ACH direct deposit to your US-based bank account. Be sure to use your correct ACH routing number, not a wire transfer number, to avoid delays or rejections.
What You’ll Need
Before getting started, make sure you have:
A US-based checking account
Your correct ACH routing number (not a wire routing number)
Your bank account number
Your Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number

Additional Requirements and Information

##### PA Payout Rules and Payout Method

Important Information on Apex Payout Methods and Procedures
At Apex, we prioritize accurate and timely payouts for all our traders and affiliates. To ensure smooth transactions, it’s crucial to follow the correct procedures when updating your payout method. Below, we’ve outlined key information and important reminders regarding payouts, including updates for non-U.S. traders and affiliates.
Payout Information: How to Request and Receive Your Payment
Apex Trader Funding provides different payout methods based on your location. Whether you're a U.S. or non-U.S. trader, it’s important to follow the correct process to ensure your payout is processed smoothly and accurately.
Payout Method Selection: U.S. vs. Non-U.S. Traders
For U.S. Traders:
Payout Method: Direct Deposit (ACH)
Payment Processing: U.S. traders will have their payments processed via ACH, using regional service providers.
Important ACH Reminder: Ensure you're using the correct ACH routing number for your bank account. ACH routing numbers and Wire Transfer numbers are often different, so verify you're using the correct one.
For Non-U.S. Traders:
Payout Method: International (via Plane)
Payment Processing: Non-U.S. traders will have their payments processed through Plane, a secure payment gateway. After your first request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank. This ensures that subsequent payouts will be processed seamlessly.
Payout Requirements and Criteria
To request a payout, you must meet the following criteria to ensure smooth and compliant processing. These steps apply to both U.S. and non-U.S. traders.
8 Trading Days: You must have completed at least 8 trading days.
Profit on 5 Days: At least 5 of those 8 days must show a profit of $50 or more.
Safety Net for First Three Payouts: The safety net is calculated as your drawdown limit plus $100. This requirement applies to your first three payouts only. For more details, please refer to Safety Net Rules. 
30% Consistency Rule - Windfall
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.
Key Details to Note:
Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout, or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Easy Calculation Method:
Formula: Highest Profit Day ÷ 0.3 = Minimum Total Profit Required
Example:
On a $50k account, if your highest profit day since your last approved payout (or since you started trading, if this is your first payout request) was $1,500:
Calculation: $1,500 ÷ 0.3 = $5,000
In this situation, to request a payout, you would have to have at least $5,000 in total profit (current balance minus starting balance). If your current total profit is below this minimum, you’ll need to continue trading until you meet this requirement before requesting a payout.
Safety Net Requirement for First Three Payouts
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size, plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If the safety net threshold has been met, a payout equal to the minimum allowed amount of $500 can be requested, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, we calculate the safety net as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600, based on the drawdown of $2,500. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
Required Minimum Balance to Request a Payout
Your account must meet the required minimum balance to approve a payout, which includes surpassing the trailing drawdown level. The trailing drawdown in a PA account stops at the starting balance plus $100.
Minimum Required Balances:
Account Size	Minimum Required Balance
$25k Account	$26,600
$50k Account	$52,600
$100k Account	$103,100
$150k Account	$155,100
$250k Account	$256,600
$300k Account	$307,600
$100k Static	$102,600
Note: For a $50k account, you cannot request a payout if your balance is $52,000. It must be at least $52,600.
Minimum and Maximum Payout Amounts
Minimum Payout: $500 for any account size. You must have at least eight (8) trading days since the last request and meet the minimum required balance.
Maximum Payouts (First Five Payouts):
Account Size	Maximum Payout
$25k Account	$1,500
$50k Account	$2,000
$100k Account	$2,500
$150k Account	$2,750
$250k Account	$3,000
$300k Account	$3,500
$100k Static	$1,000
No Maximum After Sixth Payout: Starting from the sixth payout, there’s no maximum payout amount, provided the minimum balance threshold remains in the account after the payout.
100% Payout Eligibility Guidelines
To qualify for 100% payouts, traders must first complete five approved payouts. Starting with the sixth payout, you can withdraw 100% of your profits, even if you reach this milestone earlier than four months. By following a steady 8-day payout cycle, you can achieve this in as little as 48 trading days, providing full access to your profits in approximately two months.
Key Highlights:
Eligibility: Complete five approved payouts to access 100% of your profits from the sixth payout onward.
Faster Access: Achieve this in 48 trading days by maintaining an 8-day payout cycle.
Live Prop Accounts: Withdraw profits before the sixth payout if transferred to a Live Prop Account.
Existing Traders: If you’re already receiving 100% payouts or are in your third month, this update does not impact you.
By following these guidelines, you’ll have streamlined and faster access to your earnings, providing you with more control over your profits.
Probation and Payout Guidelines
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation
Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.
Multiple Accounts and Payouts: Understanding the Benefits
At Apex Trader Funding, each account you manage is treated as a separate, stand-alone account. This allows you to maximize flexibility and opportunity when requesting payouts across multiple accounts.
How Payouts Work with Multiple Accounts
Separate Payouts: Each account operates independently, meaning you can request the maximum payout for each account during every eligible payout period.
Example Scenario:
Suppose you have ten (10) $50,000 accounts:
You can withdraw $2,000 from each account every 8 trading days, for a total of $20,000 across all accounts.
If you repeat this process over 16 trading days, you could withdraw a total of $40,000.
This independence allows you to scale your trading and withdrawals based on your overall account structure.
Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts
Increased Earning Potential: By leveraging payouts from multiple accounts, you can optimize your income within the same trading periods.
Risk Management: Multiple accounts allow you to diversify your strategies and reduce the impact of losses on any single account.
For more information on why maintaining multiple accounts can be advantageous, check out our detailed guide: Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts.
By managing multiple accounts responsibly, you can enhance both your trading opportunities and your payout potential.
How to Set Up Your Payout Method
To ensure smooth processing of your payouts, all traders must correctly set up their payout method in the Apex dashboard. The process is different for U.S. and non-U.S. traders, so follow the appropriate steps below based on your location.
Here’s what you need to do to set up your payout method:
Log in to your Apex dashboard.
Select Payout Method from the available options on your Apex dashboard.
Select International from the dropdown menu for Non-U.S. Traders.
Enter your personal details 
Select Direct Deposit from the dropdown menu for U.S. Traders.
Enter your bank details, including your ACH routing number and bank account number.
Important: Ensure you use the correct ACH routing number and not the wire transfer number.
Enter your payment details (bank information) and save.
For International traders, once you’ve completed these steps, your payout method will be set to International, and you’ll receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank account.
Company Payout Requests
For company payouts, fill out the payout form as follows:
First Name field: Enter the company name (e.g., ABC Company LLC).
Please ensure there are no special characters or symbols.
Last Name field: Enter the business owner's first and last name (e.g., John Smith).
How to Ensure Accurate Payout Processing
Matching Bank Country and Primary Residency: The country of your bank account must match your primary country of residency. For example:
If you live in the U.S., your bank account must also be based in the U.S.
If you live outside the U.S., your bank account must match the country where you reside.
Example 1: U.S. Resident
Residency: John Smith resides in Texas, U.S.
Bank Account: John provides the details of his U.S.-based bank account, including the ACH routing number, bank name, and account number.
Status: John’s payout request is approved because his bank country matches his residency, and his details are accurate.
Example 2: Non-U.S. Resident
Residency: Maria Lopez resides in Spain with a valid Spanish work permit.
Bank Account: Maria enters her details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves her details.
Status: Maria receives an email from Plane, links her account, and her payout is processed seamlessly.
Example 3: Mismatched Details
Residency: James Brown resides in Canada but lists a U.S.-based bank account.
Issue: The payout is rejected because the bank account country does not match his residency.
Resolution: James updates his details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves his details, and his request is approved.
Accuracy is Key: Make sure all information on your payout form is correct. Incorrect or incomplete details will result in delays or the rejection of your payout request. Ensure your ACH details are accurate before submitting your request.
How to Request Your Payout
To request your payout from Apex Trader Funding, follow these simple steps to ensure everything goes smoothly. Whether it’s your first time or you’ve requested payouts before, this process is quick and easy. Just make sure all the details are correct so we can get your payout processed without delay!
Log in to Your Apex Dashboard
First, head over to the Apex Trader Funding Dashboard. Use your login credentials to access your account.
Navigate to Payout Request
Once you're in your dashboard, look to the left-hand menu. You’ll see an option labeled Payout Request. Go ahead and click on it to start the process.
Follow the Prompts
After clicking on Payout Request, you'll be guided through a series of prompts. These are simple steps where you’ll enter details about your payout. Double-check everything—make sure the information matches your trading account and that there are no errors. Accuracy is key to ensuring your payout is processed without any issues.
Submit Your Request
Once you’ve reviewed everything and are confident the details are correct, go ahead and submit your payout request. That’s it! You're done!
What Happens Next?
Confirmation Email:
After submitting your payout request, the relevant department will review it to make sure everything is in order. Once it’s approved, you’ll receive a confirmation email confirming your request.
Check Your Spam or Junk Folder:
If you don’t see the confirmation email right away, don’t panic. Sometimes emails end up in your spam or junk folder. Be sure to check there if you can’t find it in your inbox.
Payout Request Processing and Timeline
Once you submit your payout request, it will undergo a structured review, approval, and transfer process. Below is a detailed explanation of each step to help you understand the timeline and what to expect during the payout process.
Payout Request Submission and Review: Once you submit your payout request, it will be reviewed and either approved or denied within 2 business days, depending on the demand and any holidays. During peak periods, the review time may vary slightly.
If your payout is denied, you’ll be informed of the reasons for the denial, and you can make the necessary adjustments for future payout requests.
Funds Transfer Initiation:  After your payout is approved, the funds will be transferred to your selected payout method. The funds transfer will generally be initiated within 3-4 business days after approval. The processing time for transferring the funds depends on the payment method you’ve selected.
For U.S. traders, this is typically ACH (Automated Clearing House), and the funds will be transferred to your U.S. bank account.
For non-U.S. traders, payments are processed via Plane (a payment gateway), and additional steps will be involved (detailed below).
Funds Arrival: After the transfer is initiated, it can take an additional 3-7 business days for the funds to appear in your bank account, depending on your bank’s processing time. Banks may take varying amounts of time to process and reflect the incoming payment, so it’s essential to check with your bank for specific timing.
International Payments via Plane: For non-U.S. traders, once your payout request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane, typically within 1-4 business days, depending on the volume of requests. Follow the instructions in the email to link your bank account. 
Be sure to check your spam or junk folders in case the invitation email ends up there.
After linking your account, Plane will process the payment, which usually takes 3-7 business days for completion.
Important Reminders:
Do NOT Submit Help Desk Tickets Immediately After Payout Request:
Please do not submit a Help Desk ticket immediately after updating your payout method or once your payout request is approved. Invitation emails are sent at different points during the processing period, not immediately.
Payment Status – PAID:
Once your payout is marked as PAID in the system, it means the funds have been successfully sent to your Plane account (for non-U.S. traders) or your bank account (for U.S. traders). The funds will be available once processing is complete.

##### How Do Payouts Work? Payouts and Performance Split-Percentages

Ready to request a payout? SETUP YOUR PAYOUT METHOD: CLICK HERE
Profit Share: Traders are entitled to 100% of the first $25,000 per account they are paid out, and 90% of the profit after that. 
You may request and receive a payout every 8 trading days
A trading day is considered from 6 PM ET- 5 PM ET the next day.
NOTE!!! Approval DOES NOT MEAN your payment has been sent out. Payments are reviewed and approved within 2 business days and may take between 3-4 business days to reach your bank account, though processing times may vary depending on factors beyond our control.
YES: Once you request a payout, you can immediately keep trading. You do NOT need to wait to trade until the payout is approved. Just be sure to trade as if the funds were already approved and removed from your balance, keeping in mind minimum thresholds so as not to blow the account.
If you submit a request and then your account balance falls below the minimum required balance to request a payout, it will simply be denied. There is no reason to request to cancel or edit it.  
***Please do NOT submit tickets to the Help Desk, or inquire on Discord, Facebook, social media, email, or other avenues asking when the payout will be approved or out of review. The Help Desk or anyone on social media is unable to assist you. The Payout Team works through requests and is unable to stop and give updates on each case while reviewing, as this will delay the process. If you have not seen your request approved within 3 business days from submission, you can then submit a Help Desk ticket. By the morning of the third business day, we should have approved or denied all payout requests. If any requests are still in an "under review" status, this means we have requested information or verification from you and are waiting for your response. Special case reviews may take longer depending on how quickly you have responded with the items requested.***
***Please do NOT submit a ticket asking where your funds are until at least seven business days after they have been released. It can take an additional 2-4 business days to see the credit reflected in your account depending on your institution, weekends, or bank holidays.***
PLEASE NOTE: Once a PA Payout request is submitted, it cannot be changed, edited, or canceled. 
PLEASE DO NOT submit tickets to the Help Desk requesting to change, edit, or cancel a payout request as they are not able to do so.
Once it is in the system, it will either be approved or denied, but we are not able to edit or cancel. As soon as you request a payout, ensure that you trade your account as if the requested money has already been deducted.
Once a PA request is approved or denied, the account will not be available for further payout requests until the next payment request period and you have traded for eight (8) more trading days. 
If you have requested a payout, and you blow the account while the request is still in either a PENDING or UNDER REVIEW status, you will not receive the payout since the account is blown.
However, if you have requested a payout and the status is APPROVED, and then subsequently blow the account, you will still get the approved requested amount. Once the payout is approved, you will receive it even if the account is "blown" the next day after approval. 
You must first complete the PA Payout Method section before you can access the payout request page. You cannot request a payout if you have not entered the correct payout payment details of where the payout will be to be sent to. 
After 8 days of trading, you will see a section available for submission: PA Request Form in your back office members' area, on the top tab options. Be sure you have hit your minimum balance and minimum trading days before requesting a payment.
According to the PA guidelines, in order to request the first payout, you must have a total of eight (8) separate, individual trading days on which you placed trades.
Subsequent payout requests also require the same minimum of eight (8) trading days between payout requests, where trades were actually traded on eight individual, separate trading days. The eight (8) active trading days are from request to request. At least 5 of those days have a profit of $50 or more.
Remember: You must separate any payout requests, whether the previous request was approved or denied, by eight (8) separate qualified trading days. 
Our system does not update the trading day count until the evening processing and the start of the 9th day. If today is your 8th trading day, you will not be able to submit a payout request until the close and update of that 8th day, which is after 6 PM ET. 
Payout approvals require compliance with the PA Contract Agreement and the Consistency Rules. You can find these listed in the agreement, on the Apex Trader Funding website, and in the FAQ section. 
A trading day is considered from 6 PM ET- 5 PM ET the next day.
For example, if you trade Sunday night at 6 PM and again on Monday morning, that is not two separate trading days. It is considered one trading day, and all trades will be counted towards Monday trades. However, if you trade Monday morning and again Tuesday morning, then yes, that is two trading days. 
Most holidays, when the market closes early, do not qualify as a separate trading day. They are rolled into the next trading day for settlement purposes with the exchanges. It is important to keep this in mind for early close trading days.
To see how many trading days you have accumulated, check on Rithmic/Tradovate. If you have not met the minimum trading days, then continue trading until the 9th day. See below for maximum payout amounts the first five (5) payouts.
There is no maximum payout on the sixth (6) payout and beyond, so long as the minimum balance threshold is in the account after the payout. A payout must be approved for it to count as a payout.
Safety Net for First Three Payouts
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size, plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If the safety net threshold has been met, a payout equal to the minimum allowed amount of $500 can be requested, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, we calculate the safety net as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600, based on the drawdown of $2,500. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
REQUIRED Minimum Balance To Request a payout
To make a payout request, your account must be at the required minimum balance to approve a payout and must already be past the trailing drawdown level. In a PA account, the trailing drawdown stops at the starting balance plus $100. Eight (8) trading days minimum are required between each payout request. See the amounts below for reference.
$25k Account - $26,600
$50k Account - $52,600
$100k Account - $103,100
$150k Account - $155,100
$250k Account - $256,600
$300k Account - $307,600
$100k Static Account- $102,600
To clarify, with a $50k account, and your balance reaches $52,000, you CANNOT request a payout. Your balance must be at least $52,600 in order to request a payout.
If you submit a request and then your account balance falls below the minimum required balance to request a payout, it will simply be denied. There is no reason to request to cancel or edit it.  
Minimum and Maximum payout amounts
MINIMUM: The Minimum Payout for any size account is $500. You must have a minimum of eight (8) trading days since the last request and meet the minimum required balance for a payout request. 
MAXIMUM: There is a maximum payout amount on accounts for the first five (5) payouts. You can take out this maximum amount after eight (8) trading days.
The maximum payout amount for each payout period, every eight (8) trading days, depends on the account size:
$25k Account - $1500
$50k Account - $2000
$100k Account - $2,500
$150k Account - $2,750
$250k Account - $3,000
$300k Account - $3,500
$100k Static Account - $1,000
100% Payout Eligibility
Sixth Payout and Beyond: Starting from their sixth payout, traders can access 100% of their profits, even if this is achieved earlier than four months.
If moved to a Live Prop Account, the trader can withdraw before their sixth payout.
Existing PA holders already at 100% or on month 3 will not be impacted.
Faster Access to Full Payouts: The payout maximum limit is now based on the number of withdrawals rather than a time period, enabling traders to achieve full payouts faster.
Speed Example:
If they follow an 8-day payout cycle, traders can achieve 100% payouts in as few as 48 trading days (approximately two months and one week).
A trader requesting payouts every 8 trading days can receive 100% of their profits by their sixth withdrawal within about two months and a week.
Probation and Payouts:
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation
Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.
TAXES: 
You will be paid as an individual contractor. You must keep the address maintained or updated with us in order to receive a 1099-NEC. All US Citizens and Entities are sent a 1099 form on January 31 of each year.
No reports are sent for Non-US citizens.
If you need tax advice or have questions, please contact your accountant. Apex is not able to give tax advice or answer questions regarding taxes, filings, citizenship, work visas, or any other tax-related questions.
The Apex Help Desk does not have any further information about taxes. Please do not submit tax questions to the Help Desk. Please contact a tax advisor. 
Each account is considered a separate, stand-alone account. This means that if you have 10 accounts, you can payout the maximum from EACH account, EACH payout period.
For example, if you have 10 50k accounts, you can withdraw $2000 from each account for a total payout of $20,000. You can do this every eight trading days for a total of $40,000 every 16 trading days.

By successfully navigating the evaluation phase, you set yourself up for the next stage, where you can move towards a funded account with a more structured trading approach.
Are Performance Accounts (PA) Live?
Performance Accounts (PAs) begin as simulated (SIM) accounts, but they use live market data to replicate real trading conditions. While these accounts are initially simulated, traders are paid just as they would be with a live account.
Starting with a SIM account offers advantages for both traders and the company. Trading can be unpredictable, and many traders may struggle to maintain their accounts in the early stages. Using SIM accounts initially provides a safety net, reducing the risk for both parties while still ensuring a realistic trading experience.
Transitioning to Live Accounts
When a trader demonstrates consistent performance in their SIM account, the trades are mirrored in a live account through an Application Programming Interface (API). This allows traders to continue refining their strategies while their success is evaluated in real-time market conditions.
Once long-term consistency is confirmed, the trader will be contacted regarding a transition to a live account. At this stage, the trader is directly engaging with live markets, and their account is no longer simulated. This process is directly communicated to the traders considered for Live Accounts. 
The Help Desk has no further information regarding hypothetical questions about Live Accounts. You will be contacted when considered. Do not submit tickets regarding this.
Key Terms:
SIM (Simulated): A practice account that replicates live market data but does not involve actual money or live trades.
API (Application Programming Interface): A tool that connects systems, enabling trades from a SIM account to be mirrored in a live account.
By taking this step-by-step approach, Performance Accounts (PAs) strike a balance between providing traders an opportunity to prove themselves and ensuring responsible risk management.
Trailing Drawdown Rule
In a Performance Account, the trailing drawdown starts at the liquidation threshold, which is determined by your plan's max drawdown amount. As your account balance increases, the trailing drawdown follows your peak unrealized balance until it reaches a fixed point, which is called the Safety Net (initial balance + drawdown limit + $100). The trailing drawdown stops moving when your peak unrealized account balance reaches the Safety Net. For a reminder on how the Trailing Drawdown Threshold works, click here.
Example; 
A $50,000 account has a safety net of $52,600, which is the $2500 drawdown plus $100.
A $150,000 account has a safety net of $155,100, which is the $5000 drawdown plus $100.
If you have $6000 profit for both accounts, the drawdown threshold will still be fixed at the starting balance plus $100.
Contract Scaling Rule
To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.
Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For 100K Static Accounts: Full contracts can be traded after reaching the safety net amount of $2,600.
For example, on a $50,000 Performance Account (PA) with a maximum of 10 contracts, traders can initially trade up to 5 contracts. When the account EOD balance reaches $52,600 ($50,000 initial balance + $2,500 trailing drawdown + $100 buffer), the trailing stop no longer applies, and traders can trade the full 10 contracts.
Once the trailing threshold is reached, traders can continue using the full contract limit even if the account balance drops below the threshold.
Single Violation Penalty: If more than half of the maximum allowed contracts are accidentally traded, traders are expected to close out the excessive contracts immediately. Failure to do so may result in the payout request being denied and the account being reset to the EOD balance from the previous trading day, which is the day before the first scaling rule violation occurred.
The trader would then need to complete 8 additional compliant trading days before becoming eligible to request another payout.
Consistent Violation Penalty: Blatant or repeated violations of the scaling rule will result in account closure and forfeiture of all balances.
30% Negative P&L Rule - Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (P&L) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative P&L cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.
This is not a daily loss limit, but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your open negative P&L should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.
Limit on Losses: Open trades should not exceed a 30% negative drawdown from the account’s profit balance.
Example: For a $50,000 account, if the profit balance is $4,000, a trader should not allow a drawdown exceeding $1,200.
New/Low Profit Accounts: For accounts that are new or have low profits, the 30% rule is based on the trailing threshold (e.g., 30% of $2,500 on a $50,000 account would be $750).
Adjustment Based on Growth: If the end-of-day (EOD) profit balance doubles the safety net, traders may use a 50% drawdown limit instead of 30% starting with the next full trading session.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, if you accumulate $2,600 in profit and pass the safety net, your risk is calculated based on 30% of that $2,600. If your profits rise to $5,200, your drawdown allowance can increase to $2,600 (50% of $5,200).
At Apex Trader Funding, responsible trading is at the core of our practices, and managing drawdowns is a crucial part of that. Here’s what you need to know:
Continuous Monitoring: We encourage you to regularly monitor your trades and adjust your positions as needed to stay within these limits. If your drawdown approaches 30%, consider closing or adjusting your trades to avoid breaching the limit. Quick adjustments can help prevent any compliance issues.
Temporary Exceedances: If your drawdown momentarily exceeds 30% but you act quickly to manage the situation, there won’t be an automatic penalty. However, repeated or significant breaches could lead to warnings or account restrictions.
Adhering to these guidelines can ensure that your trading strategy remains robust and sustainable. These terms should be strictly followed to ensure consistent compliance with Apex's 30% negative P&L rule.
Static Accounts
The 30% Negative P&L rule for Static Accounts is designed to help manage risk by ensuring that losses are kept within safe limits. The rule applies in two stages: one when the account balance is below the safety net, and another when it exceeds the safety net.
Below the Safety Net ($2,600): When the account balance is below the $2,600 safety net, the maximum loss per trade is $187.50. This is 30% of the fixed $625 drawdown that applies to accounts at this stage. Essentially, until the balance surpasses the safety net, the rule restricts your loss on any single trade to $187.50.
Above the Safety Net ($2,600): Once the account balance exceeds $2,600, the 30% Negative P&L rule is recalculated based on the current profit balance in the account. For example, if your account reaches $103,000, which includes a $3,000 profit, the maximum allowable loss per trade is $900 (30% of the $3,000 profit).
30% Consistency Rule - Windfall
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.
Key Details to Note:
Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout, or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Easy Calculation Method:
Formula: Highest Profit Day ÷ 0.3 = Minimum Total Profit Required
Example:
On a $50k account, if your highest profit day since your last approved payout (or since you started trading, if this is your first payout request) was $1,500:
Calculation: $1,500 ÷ 0.3 = $5,000
In this situation, to request a payout, you would have to have at least $5,000 in total profit (current balance minus starting balance). If your current total profit is below this minimum, you’ll need to continue trading until you meet this requirement before requesting a payout.
Risk Management, Stop Losses, Profit Targets, Trailing
Apex Trader Funding provides traders with an opportunity to demonstrate disciplined risk management and effective trading strategies. Proper risk management is not just encouraged but is mandatory for all accounts, ensuring that trading is conducted responsibly and without speculative or reckless behavior.
5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule
The 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule is a risk management guideline that ensures your trades are balanced with a responsible amount of risk relative to the potential profit. For every trade you make, your stop loss should not exceed five times the amount of your profit target.
For example:
If your profit target is 10 ticks, your maximum stop loss should be 50 ticks (5 times your profit target).
If you set a stop loss beyond 50 ticks, such as 100 ticks, this would violate the rule.
Following the 5:1 rule helps you manage risk by ensuring that you are not taking excessive losses relative to your target profits. This helps protect your account balance and encourages more disciplined trading over time. It also promotes a strategy where your potential rewards are always greater than the risks you are taking on each trade. By following the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio, you maintain a disciplined trading approach that supports long-term success and helps you manage risk effectively.
Stop Losses and Risk Management
Stop Losses Are Required: Trading without a stop loss or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk is strictly prohibited. Every trade must have a pre-defined risk level, either through manual stop-loss orders or a mental plan that adheres to your strategy. Letting an account "blow out" by hitting the Trailing Threshold is not acceptable.
Risk-to-Reward Ratios: Apex enforces a maximum risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1. For instance, if your profit target is 10 ticks, your stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks. Similarly, if your goal is to make $100 in profit, the stop loss should not risk more than $500. This ensures responsible trading and prevents excessive risk on trades.
Prohibited Practices: Strategies that involve “all-in” trades with maximum contract sizes, particularly at the start of a PA account, to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown are prohibited. These windfall or gambling approaches violate Apex’s standards and may result in forfeiture of accounts or payouts.
Proper Use of Stop Losses and Profit Targets 
Planned Exits for Both Losses and Profits: Before initiating any trade, traders must have a clear plan for managing both risk and profit targets. Stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops should align with the strategy's historical performance and back-tested data.
Trailing Stops for Profit Protection: As the market moves in your favor, trailing stops should be used to secure gains while allowing profits to run during trends. However, stops should not be moved backward to increase risk and potentially violate the drawdown rules. Adjusting stops forward to protect profits is a key aspect of effective risk management.
ATM Strategies for Automation: Apex encourages the use of ATM (Advanced Trade Management) strategies, which automate stop-loss and profit-target levels. These can be adjusted during trades to protect profits while adapting to market conditions.
Mental Stops Are Permitted: Traders familiar with their strategy may use mental stops instead of placing hard stop-loss orders. However, mental stops must still be honored. For traders on Probation, hard stop-loss levels are mandatory.
Trending and Long-Term Strategies: In trending or longer-term strategies where specific profit targets may not be clear, the initial stop loss becomes especially important. It defines the maximum risk, allowing the trade to be managed responsibly, even in volatile conditions.
Payout Evaluation Requirements
During the eight-day evaluation period, traders must demonstrate consistency by achieving a profit of at least $50 on five different trading days. Strategies such as "flipping" trades—closing and re-entering positions to adjust to market conditions—are allowed as long as they align with a structured plan and meet the $50 minimum profit requirement on eligible days.
Consistency and Discipline
Apex requires traders to demonstrate consistent and disciplined trading. Risk management strategies should avoid speculative windfall approaches, such as:
Entering large contract positions at the start of a PA account in an attempt to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown.
Using the Trailing Threshold limit to manage risk without applying proper stop-loss strategies.
Traders are expected to maintain consistent trade management practices, adhering to their system's guidelines for stop losses, profit targets, and risk-to-reward ratios.
Risk management is the cornerstone of successful trading. Every trade must include a defined risk level, a clear exit strategy for both profit and loss, and adherence to the 5:1 maximum risk-to-reward ratio. Reckless trading practices—such as speculative “all-in” trades, adjusting stops to increase risk, or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk—are prohibited. By implementing a systematic and disciplined approach, traders can achieve consistent results while protecting their accounts and advancing toward Live Prop Trading Accounts.
Max Contracts Rule
The Max Contracts Rule ensures traders adhere to the defined contract limits for their account and discourages any attempts to abuse or circumvent these limits.
Key Guidelines:
Traders must not exceed the maximum contract limit set for their account at any time.
Attempts to bypass the limit through combined instruments or micro contracts are prohibited.
Examples of Violations:
Trading the maximum contracts on multiple instruments simultaneously (e.g., 10 contracts on ES and 10 on YM for a 10-contract limit account).
Exceeding the maximum contract limit directly (e.g., trading 20 contracts on a 10-contract limit account).
Using micro contracts in a way that circumvents the maximum contract rule (e.g., excessively trading micro contracts to replicate full contract exposure).
Violations or attempts to abuse the max contracts rule will result in the termination of the account without a refund or payout. Traders are expected to respect these limits to maintain account compliance and avoid penalties.
By adhering to the Max Contracts Rule, traders can ensure they remain in good standing while fostering disciplined trading practices.
Contract Size Consistency Rule
Maintaining a consistent approach to contract sizes is essential for demonstrating disciplined and professional trading behavior. While the rules allow flexibility for strategic adjustments, erratic or manipulative changes in contract sizes are strictly prohibited.
Key Guidelines:
Consistent Strategy: Traders must use contract sizes that reflect a consistent trading approach. Adjustments based on market conditions, such as reducing size during high volatility or increasing size as the account balance grows, are acceptable as long as they align with a systematic strategy.
Example: Starting with 2 contracts and scaling up as profits increase is consistent. Conversely, trading 10 contracts one day and dropping to 2 contracts the next solely to secure a payout is not.
Scaling with Growth: As the account balance grows and the cushion increases, contract sizes should scale proportionally. This reflects disciplined account management and responsible risk-taking.
Example: A growing balance justifies a steady increase in contract sizes. Reducing contract sizes despite growth out of fear of losing profit before a withdrawal is considered a lack of discipline and an invalid strategy.
Responsible Adjustments for Losses: If the account balance decreases due to losses, it is reasonable and responsible to reduce contract sizes to manage risk. Similarly, after a withdrawal reduces the account balance, trading smaller sizes is prudent until growth resumes.
Prohibited Practices:
It is not allowed to use large contract sizes early in a PA Account to chase lucky trades or recover losses, followed by a sudden reduction in size.
Cycling through multiple PA Accounts by starting with substantial sizes, losing the balance, and resetting accounts to repeat this behavior is considered manipulative and is grounds for account termination.
Making drastic, inconsistent changes in contract size solely to manipulate payouts or the evaluation process will result in forfeiture of payouts and, potentially, probation status.
Expectations for Payout Eligibility:
Traders must maintain consistent trading behavior throughout the account's lifecycle, from inception to payout. This includes using the same contracts, sizes, and targets unless modifications are made logically due to account growth or loss.
To demonstrate profit stability, traders may be required to trade consistently for eight days with uniform contract sizes before becoming eligible for a payout request.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can ensure their trading approach reflects professionalism and discipline. Apex is committed to funding responsible traders, not those engaging in high-risk, erratic, or manipulative practices. Consistency is key to maintaining account compliance and securing payouts.
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Rule
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) involves entering additional trades in the same direction as the original order, even if the market moves against the trader’s position. As the market moves contrary to the trade, the trader continues to add more entries in the same direction.
Key Guidelines:
Permitted Use: DCA is allowed under this agreement with no restrictions on contract size for additional entries.
No Entry Restrictions: There are no specific rules for determining entry points, timeframes, or distances from the original order.
Risk Management: Traders must maintain responsible risk-to-reward ratios when using DCA.
Compliance with Consistency Rules: DCA is acceptable as long as it does not violate other consistency rules, such as the 30% profit in a day rule or the 30% negative P&L rule.
Responsible Application: Traders are expected to apply DCA consistently and responsibly to adhere to these rules and avoid potential issues.
By following these guidelines, traders can effectively utilize DCA while adhering to the account’s rules and risk management framework.
Adding to Trades
Traders may add to their trades as the market moves in their favor, following a defined trading strategy or system rules. For example, if a trader enters a long position and the market moves positively, they may add additional long contracts to capitalize on the trend.
Key Guidelines:
Strategic Entries: Traders are permitted to scale into winning trades in PA Accounts, using larger contract sizes if supported by their strategy.
Directional Bias: All additions must align with a clear directional bias and follow a consistent, defined strategy. Random or reckless entries in hopes of a market turnaround are not allowed.
Acceptable Scaling: Adding contracts to a profitable trade as part of a structured approach is acceptable and encouraged for disciplined trading.
Prohibited Practices: Entering large contract sizes at the outset without a clear strategy or placing trades purely in anticipation of a market reversal is prohibited.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can effectively scale into profitable trades while maintaining consistency and professionalism in their trading approach.
Safety Net Requirement Rule
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If you have reached the safety net threshold, you can request a payout of at least $500, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, the drawdown is $2,500, so the safety net is calculated as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
Flipping Trades Rule
Flipping is Allowed at Apex Trader Funding, but it must be done strategically and within the guidelines. Flipping refers to opening and closing trades quickly within the same day. While this is allowed, it must meet certain criteria to count toward your trading goals. Here's what you need to know about the Flipping Trades Rule.
Conditions for Flipping:
Minimum Profit Requirement:
To count towards your trading day, you must achieve a minimum profit of $50 per day from the flipped trades. This ensures that flipping is done with a goal of steady profitability, rather than just making quick trades for the sake of meeting minimum activity.
Consistent Performance:
You must flip trades for at least 5 trading days to meet the eligibility criteria for consistent trading performance. This means that on each of those days, you need to hit the $50 profit target.
Example of Flipping Trades:
Day 1: A trader opens and closes several quick trades throughout the day, earning a $60 profit. Since this exceeds the $50 minimum, this day counts toward the 5-day trading goal.
Day 2 to Day 5: The same trader repeats the process over the next four days, earning a profit of at least $50 each day. This results in meeting the 5-day trading consistency requirement.
One-Direction Rule (Directionally biased trading)
Single Direction Rule: Traders are only allowed to hold a position in one direction at any time—either long (buy) or short (sell). Traders are also prohibited from using a non-directionally biased strategy where they have open orders for both sides of the market
No Hedging: Holding both long and short positions simultaneously on the same or correlated instrument is strictly prohibited. This rule ensures that trades are based on strategic analysis rather than speculative attempts to hedge both sides during a news-driven breakout.
News Trading Rule
Apex Trader Funding allows traders to engage in news trading during significant market events, where rapid price movements can present profitable opportunities. 
Automation in Trading
At Apex Trader Funding, the use of automation is strictly prohibited on PA and Live accounts. This includes any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence), Autobots, algorithms, fully automated trading systems, and high-frequency trading (HFTs). These types of systems that trade without active human intervention are not allowed.
Any type of hands-off, set-and-forget, or set-and-walk-away trading, including systems that run continuously 24 hours a day, is strictly prohibited. Using these types of automation will result in the immediate closure of your PA or Live account and the forfeiture of all funds and balances.
Semi-automated software can be used, but it must be actively monitored by the trader at all times. This means the trader must be present and actively managing the trades, making adjustments based on market conditions, news events, and other factors. The software should assist in executing trades based on predefined rules, but the trader must remain in control, overseeing every aspect of the trading process.
It’s also advised to turn off or pause the semi-automated software when market conditions aren’t ideal, or when a trade setup isn’t clear. The purpose of this software is to assist with the speed and accuracy of placing trades—not to act as a fully automated system that trades on its own.
By following these guidelines, you ensure that you remain in full control of your trades, using automation responsibly to enhance your trading process without replacing the trader's judgment.
Please note that the results from the use of any trade copiers or external programs are the sole responsibility of the trader listed on the account. Apex Trader Funding reserves the right to take action should there be any rule violations resulting from the use of these programs. 
Hedging and Correlated Instruments Rule
Traders shall not trade one direction on minis and another direction on micros at the same time. Traders shall not spread trade indices, i.e., long ES, and short YM. All Apex accounts must be traded directionally only and never be both long and short concurrently in the same account or in other accounts in any correlated markets. This includes all indices, metals, grains, currencies, or any correlating instrument, no matter the size, i.e., micro, mini, etc. For example, the trader cannot be short NQ and Long ES under any circumstance.
Copy or Trading Services Operations or Participation
Performance Accounts (PA) and Live Prop Accounts must be traded exclusively by the individual listed on the account. Under no circumstances can these accounts be managed or influenced by any other party, person, system, automated trading bot, copy trading service, or trade mirroring software.
Failure to comply with this rule constitutes an immediate breach of contract and will result in the closure of all associated user accounts. Traders are required to maintain sole responsibility for all trading activity within their accounts to ensure compliance with Apex’s standards.
Defined System with Set Rules
At Apex Trader Funding, having a defined trading strategy with clear rules is essential for success. Traders are required to establish a system that includes set guidelines for entries, stops, targets, and trailing stops, and must follow these rules consistently and with discipline. This approach is designed to foster steady, sustainable trading, not speculative or erratic behavior.
What is a Defined System?
Traders must have a systematic approach to their trading that can be explained and tracked. The system should include:
Set Rules for every trade (entry points, stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops).
A normal day-to-day system that can be consistently applied across multiple trading sessions.
Clear, trackable performance that can be explained if requested, ensuring transparency.
This systematic approach is critical for ensuring that the trader’s decisions are based on strategy, not emotion or random actions.
What Apex Doesn’t Want
Apex is not looking for traders who gamble with their accounts or aim for "lottery-style lucky windfalls." Traders who blow through multiple accounts in pursuit of big, unpredictable profits do not demonstrate the consistency and discipline Apex values. Think of it this way: If you were funding a trader, would you feel comfortable with someone who consistently takes reckless risks without a structured approach?
Review Process for Compliance
Apex reserves the right to request a detailed explanation of your trading system, including:
Marked-up charts of trades you’ve executed, as evidence of consistent rule adherence.
A live Zoom session to observe and confirm that you’re following your strategy during actual trading sessions.
Recordings of your trading sessions to review your system’s consistency, including explanations of your entries and exits.
Documentation showing the tools, indicators, platforms, and contract sizes used during your trading sessions.
Apex will use these materials to assess whether your trading strategy is consistent and aligned with the rules you’ve set. This process ensures that you’re adhering to a defined system and not relying on random or speculative actions.
Directional Bias and Consistency
Apex only approves directional trading strategies, where there is a clear bias for the trade. This means you should always have a predetermined direction and bias based on your system and not execute trades without this clarity. Traders are not allowed to place:
Bracket orders in both directions without a clear directional bias (e.g., long limit order and short limit order placed in anticipation of a breakout).
Trading strategies that involve chasing market movements or seeking windfall profits without a systematic approach.
This type of non-systematic trading, where trades are placed without a clear direction or rationale, is often a sign of a trader who does not have a defined strategy and is instead speculating on market moves. Apex does not tolerate this behavior.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
Any funds earned during periods of non-compliance or from trades that do not align with the approved system will be deducted from the account. This is in line with the PA Consistency guidelines outlined in the FAQ section and the video series on the Apex Trader Funding website.
Prohibited Activities
To maintain integrity and ensure funding is provided only to disciplined and consistent traders, Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits the following activities in Performance Accounts (PA):
Trading With Risk Management: All trades must have either pending or mental stop losses and a well-defined risk management strategy. Trading without these measures is strictly prohibited.
High-Risk Strategies: Strategies that involve small profit targets while risking disproportionately large amounts are not allowed. For example, setting a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss demonstrates unacceptable risk management.
Using the Trailing Threshold as a Stop Loss: Traders are prohibited from using the account's full threshold as a stop-loss mechanism to absorb large losses, leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling Evaluation Accounts: Purchasing multiple discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and intentionally "blow up" accounts in pursuit of windfall profits is not permitted.
Unsustainable Strategies: Any trading, risk management, or implementation that fails to demonstrate consistent growth and sustainability is prohibited. This includes schemes or behaviors that do not align with responsible trading practices.
Deviating from Professional Standards: Traders must employ strategies and risk management techniques consistent with those they would use in a personally funded account at a registered broker. Apex does not fund traders who deviate from this standard.
Manipulation of the simulated trading environment: Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits manipulation or exploitation of the simulation environment in any way including High Frequency Trading (HFT) or any other exploitative strategies.
Unauthorized Users: Allowing any individual other than the registered owner to access or perform account verification is strictly prohibited. Apex reserves the right to request additional information — including audits and verification procedures — from the account owner to ensure that only the authorized user is trading or accessing the account and to enforce compliance with the contract.
Account and Resource Sharing: Sharing MAC addresses, computers, IPs, credit cards, or trade copying with other traders is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in account closure, forfeiture of funds, and potential additional verification or audits to ensure compliance.
Multiple Account Creation: Creating multiple user accounts is prohibited and is a bannable offense. For more information, please see the following article: Apex Trader Funding Accounts.
Traders engaging in these prohibited activities will forfeit their accounts and all associated balances. Apex reserves the right to audit accounts further if there is a suspicion of non-compliance to guarantee adherence to the trader agreement.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can maintain their accounts in good standing and demonstrate the consistent, disciplined approach Apex seeks to fund.
Account Probation Status
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. For more information, please refer to the details provided in the notification email. Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
If the account does not meet the requirements during the probation period, further action may be taken, including denial of payouts, profit removal, and/or account closure.
Remember: Probation is a chance to improve and prove that you can maintain a consistent, responsible trading strategy. By maintaining a consistent, disciplined approach to your trading during probation, you can restore your account to good standing and continue working towards a successful partnership with Apex Trader Funding.
Summary of Core Trading Rules
Use a Genuine Trading Strategy: Traders must employ a consistent, real-world trading strategy that aligns with live market conditions.
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is Allowed: DCA is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative P&L, etc.).  DCA needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Flipping Trades is Allowed: Opening and closing trades quickly to count as a trading day is permitted, as long as the $50 minimum profit for 5 days is satisfied.
News Trading is Allowed (with Restrictions):
Trading based on news events is permitted; however, traders cannot take opposing positions (e.g., long and short) on the same news event.
News trading is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative P&L, etc.). 
News trading needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Trade Half Contracts Until Trailing Stop is Achieved: Traders are limited to trading half of the available contracts until they meet the trailing stop threshold, encouraging careful risk management.
Maintain a 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio on Trades: Ensure a maximum 5:1 risk-to-reward ratio on all trades. For instance, if targeting a profit of 10 ticks, the stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks.
Observe the 30% Negative P&L Limit (Adjustable to 50%):
Maintain a 30% drawdown limit based on the account’s profit balance. As the account grows, this limit may be adjusted to 50%, providing more flexibility as the account becomes more established.
Example: A trader starts with a 30% drawdown limit, which can be raised to 50% once their account balance meets specified growth conditions.
Practical Example: A trader adhering to a defined, consistent strategy, observing the half-contract limit until the trailing stop is cleared, maintaining a 5:1 risk-reward ratio, and ensuring no drawdown exceeds 30% (or 50% if eligible) would be considered fully compliant under Apex rules.

Our Evaluation and PA Charts provide a clear visual overview of your trading performance and account status. The Eval Charts or PA Charts sections in the sidebar on the left-hand side are where you access these detailed graphs and tables. 
At the top, you’ll see a cumulative Profit and Loss (PnL) chart, which shows how your account’s profits or losses have changed over time, measured in trading days.
Directly underneath, each row of the table displays key account metrics updated nightly at midnight ET. These include your most recent trade date, account type, total PnL, and the number of trading days completed. You can also see critical thresholds such as the trailing stop (maximum allowed drawdown), current account balance, target profit levels, and an easy-to-read progress bar that visually indicates how close you are to reaching the goals or potential breaches. 
Finally, the status and state columns inform you if the account is active, or passed, ensuring you always know exactly where you stand in your Evaluation or PA journey.
Signatures Tab
The Signatures tab in your Apex Dashboard streamlines the process of completing account agreements and facilitating payment for your funded accounts.
Once you open this section from the sidebar menu, you’ll see a list of your accounts, each displayed along with its signature status.
If an account’s signature is pending, simply click on it to finalize the required documents. Completed signatures will clearly state “Completed” next to the account, confirming that the necessary agreements are in place.
Next to each signed account, you’ll find a direct payment link (e.g., “50k Tradovate”), making it easy to process any related fees without navigating elsewhere. The date column provides a timestamp of when the signature was completed or when payment became due, ensuring you have a clear, chronological record of all completed steps. 
Affiliate, Payout Method, Address
Apex Trader Funding offers a robust affiliate program designed to reward partners who refer new traders. This guide provides essential information on accessing the program, understanding the commission payout schedule, managing payout methods, and updating account details to ensure seamless transactions.
Accessing the Affiliate Program
For general information about Apex Trader Funding’s Affiliate Program, visit the Apex Trader Funding Affiliate Program page. Alternatively, you can access this information directly from Apex Trader Funding’s Home Page by scrolling to the bottom and selecting the AFFILIATES link under the RESOURCES section of the ATF landing page.
Commission Payout Schedule
Apex Trader Funding maintains a transparent and structured commission payout schedule for its referring affiliates:
Monthly Reports: Commission reports detailing earnings from the previous month are generated on the first day of each month. For example, commissions earned from August 1-31 will appear in the report generated on September 1.
Payout Timeline: Payments are processed by the 15th of the current month following the report generation. Using the previous example, the $100 commission from August will be paid by September 15.
Processing Time: Once released, payouts typically take 3-7 business days to reach your bank account. It is important to note that different financial institutions may vary in processing times.
Important: Do not submit a support ticket regarding the status of your funds until 7 business days after the payment has been released. This allows sufficient time for the transaction to reflect in your account.
Minimum Affiliate Payout Requirements
Apex Trader Funding requires a minimum payout balance of $100. If your monthly commissions do not meet this threshold, the amount will carry over to subsequent months until the total reaches $100. For instance:
June Commission: If you earn $30 in June, no payout will occur on July 15 since the total is below $100.
July Commission: Earning an additional $80 in July brings the cumulative total to $110, which will be paid out on August 15.
This policy applies uniformly across all plans, including Tradovate and Rithmic.
Payout Methods
Apex Trader Funding has introduced a new payout system for Referring Affiliates and Performance Account Contractors. To ensure timely and accurate payments, follow these guidelines:
Update Payout Information: It is crucial to update your payout method with accurate information, especially for ACH payments to U.S. bank accounts. Incorrect details can delay or prevent payouts.
Discontinued Services: Apex no longer uses Wise and DEEL for payouts. All international payouts are managed through the designated payment service provider, Plane.
Payment Form Completion: Ensure the entire payout form is filled out correctly. Pay attention to distinguishing between Wire Transfer and ACH routing numbers.
Company Payouts: If requesting a payout for a company, enter the Full Company Name in the “First Name” field (e.g., ABC Company, LLC.) and the first and last name of the business owner in the “Last Name” field (e.g., John Smith).
Important for Non-U.S. Traders
Non-U.S. traders and affiliates must select the INTERNATIONAL OPTION for payouts to avoid processing delays. By opting for an alternative payment service provider, you acknowledge the potential for significant payment delays.
Invitation Emails: Upon receiving your first international payout, an invitation email from our international payment processor, Plane, will be sent during the processing period. Do not submit a help desk ticket if you do not receive this email immediately, as processing can take up to two weeks.
Updating Payout Method and Address
To ensure timely payouts, affiliates, and PA Account Holders must keep their payout methods and addresses up to date:
Payout Schedules: Refer to Apex’s website for specific payout schedules for PA Account Holders and Affiliates.
Updating Payout Method: Update your payout method by the specified dates each month. Access the payout method update form here. {Needs a link}
Address Updates: If you need to update your address, submit a support ticket with your complete and accurate address details to the Help Desk.
Maintaining current payout information and adhering to the outlined schedules ensures smooth and timely commission processing.

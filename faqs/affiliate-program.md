To preserve the integrity of the program, we do not accept applications from:

Applicants who share codes exclusively within private circles—such as friends, family, or closed groups—or who intend to use the program primarily for personal referrals or mutual benefit
Applicants with no public presence, content, or audience in the trading or financial space
Applicants who are not actively creating content or providing educational, analytical, or community value within the trading or finance industry
Coupon and discount sites or similar platforms that promote codes broadly without offering meaningful or original content

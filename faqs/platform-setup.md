NinjaTrader Setup

1.  Enter your email and choose Sign Up at https://account.ninjatrader.com/register **

Please do not use sign up with Google or Apple, as you must input your own email to get the link to continue the setup.

**Make sure you do NOT have any AD blockers/Pop-up blockers on. Try different browsers if you are still having issues.

 



 

2. A screen asking you to confirm your email address will appear.



 

3. Check your email for the confirmation request and select Confirm Email Address.



 

4. Please create a Username and Password. Read and agree with the required documents.

Then select Create User.

Make sure to save your username and password somewhere you can copy/paste them later when accessing the desktop application.



 

5. After that, you will be directed to the Get Started page. Please click on Try risk-free simulated trading.



 

6. Then Enter your First Name, Last Name, and Phone.



 

7. Next, please click Continue to go to the NinjaTrader Dashboard.

If Choose Your Platform appears, simply X out of that screen:



 

8. Now, Click on the Download button on the bottom left.



 

9. Then, download the Most Recent Release of NinjaTrader.



 

10. While this is downloading, please click on the top right ICON and select settings.



 

11. Next, click on Preferences > and select Numeric.



 

12. Now that NinjaTrader is installed, open NinjaTrader. Enter the Username and Password you created for your ninjatrader.com account.

Each time you start NinjaTrader, you will need to enter the Username and Password you signed up with for NinjaTrader, then click Log In.  

 



 

13.  NinjaTrader will start up. After this, you will see the NinjaTrader Console.

NOTE: If you see Live or Simulation dialog box, always select Simulation, as our accounts only run in simulation mode. Live is if you have your own funds with NinjaTrader directly.

Please go to Tools > Options > General and verify that the Multi-provider box is CHECKED. Click
Apply > OK.



After you check the Multi-Provider checkbox, click Apply > Ok. Then please Restart NinjaTrader.

 

14. You must shut down and Restart Ninja at this point.

This will allow you to connect to your My Rithmic for NinjaTrader Brokerage and, if you use NinjaTrader Brokerage, your personal account (if you have a personal account) simultaneously. You will need to make sure you have connection setups for both.

 

You can now click on Connections > Configure to set up your My Rithmic for NinjaTrader Brokerage Connection.



Click Connections > configure, and set up this screen:



 

15. Next, click on My Rithmic for NinjaTrader Brokerage to connect to your Apex accounts.



16. You are now connected to the Apex Rithmic Accounts to trade.

NOTE:  If this was an upgrade to an existing NinjaTrader install, open the Connections menu item and verify all of your connections are there.  If you do not see the options to create new connections in the Connections menu items, following these instructions will fix that.


Please note: You should make sure that all your drivers are up to date to ensure that your machine is performing at the highest possible level. This includes your GPU drivers.

Critical:
OCO (One Cancels Other) orders for Rithmic are locally simulated on your PC. This means that NinjaTrader must be connected to your broker in order for the OCO capability to function. If you are disconnected and one of the OCO orders is filled, the other WILL NOT be automatically canceled.

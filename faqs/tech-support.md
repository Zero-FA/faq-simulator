Can I Convert Between Rithmic, Tradovate, and WealthCharts?
Converting between Rithmic, Tradovate, and WealthCharts is not possible due to differences in account setups, data routing, and fee structures. Each platform operates independently and requires its own dedicated account and subscription plan. If you wish to switch to a different platform, you’ll need to sign up for a new plan specific to that platform.
How Important Is It That I Sign Up for the Right Plan?
It is PARAMOUNT that you choose the correct plan either through the web page or the dashboard. Selecting the right plan is crucial, as there are NO REFUNDS or exceptions if you select the incorrect plan or platform. We incur charges for every new account setup and cannot issue refunds for user mistakes.
Read very carefully before you click! Ensure that you have thoroughly reviewed all options and selected the plan that best fits your trading needs to avoid unnecessary charges and complications.
Final Thoughts
Choosing between Rithmic, Tradovate, and WealthCharts ultimately depends on your trading preferences:
Opt for Rithmic if you prioritize high-speed execution, algorithmic-assisted trading, and customizable solutions.
Choose Tradovate if you value a modern, intuitive platform with integrated tools and cost-effective pricing.

Encountering login issues with RTrader? Follow these troubleshooting steps to regain access:
Use the Correct Version
Ensure you are using the APEX VERSION of RTrader.
Delete any other versions of RTrader from your computer.
Uninstall Existing RTrader Pro.gif
Verify Login Credentials
Do not use your website login. You must use the RTrader-specific login and password provided to you.
If you’ve logged in before, double-check for any typos, extra spaces, or other user errors in your username or password.
Copy and paste your username and password instead of typing them to avoid mistakes.
Check Account Status
Visit your members’ area to verify your account’s expiration date.

Ensure Profile Accuracy:
Confirm that your address and zip code are correctly entered in your profile. Incorrect information can prevent account creation.

Removing Canceled Accounts from Your Rithmic Dashboard
Managing your accounts is crucial for maintaining a streamlined trading environment. Follow these steps to remove canceled accounts from Rithmic Dashboard and NinjaTrader:
Access Member Dashboard:
Log in to your member dashboard on the Apex Trader Funding website.
Locate the Account:
Find the account you wish to remove from both Rithmic and your trading platform. The account must be canceled for it to be removed from Rithmic.
Remove the Account:
Click on the “Remove from Rithmic Dashboard” link associated with the account.
Important:
Do not submit a help desk ticket to reverse this action; it cannot be undone.
Only remove accounts when you are not in an active trade, as RTrader will auto-disconnect.
This option is only available for already canceled accounts.
Reopen RTrader Pro:
After removal, reopen RTrader Pro to ensure the changes take effect.
Additional Notes:
Responsibility: It is the trader’s responsibility to use this function only when all accounts are flat.
Account Inactivity: Removing an account from your Rithmic Dashboard will deactivate it, and you will no longer be able to pass the account into a PA.
Expiration: Canceled accounts will automatically be removed from your member dashboard on their expiration date, or after 7 days of being in Admin Only - whichever comes first.

Tradovate Group Management (Copy Trader)
Tradovate has a limited trade copier built into it. Follow these steps to enable and access it.
Log in to Tradovate. Select the Trading Mode Simulation after logging in.
After logging in, click on the application settings icon in the top right corner of your charts screen.
When the Settings page comes up, click on the Add-Ons tab. Then choose to activate Group Trade:
After clicking Activate, you'll need to log out of Tradovate and log back in to enable the Trade copier feature.
Once you're logged back in, go to the accounts drop-down and click on Manage Groups:
Click on the "+" sign to create a group, then give your group a name:
After you've created your group, click and drag the accounts you want in your trade copier group from the left-hand frame to the right-hand frame:
You adjust the number of contracts you'd like to trade by moving the Qty numbers up or down. After you create your group, click the Save button, acknowledge the creation of the group, and then click on the Close button.
Once you save the group, it will appear in the Account drop-down menu.
Select the group you wish to use for trading to have your trades copied across multiple accounts. You may create multiple groups and switch between them.
Tradovate Groups (Trade Copier) forbids the use of Bracket orders (ATMs). If you want to use bracket orders (ATMs), you must use NinjaTrader.
Other things to note about the Tradovate groups:
You must have one of the accounts selected, which is part of the group that you wish to copy trades across. For example, if you have accounts 1-6 in the group but you have account 7 selected, the trades will not be copied across accounts 1-6.
If you specified more than one contract in the group setup, your Qty (number of contracts) must be a multiple of the combined total. For example, three accounts x two contracts = six total contracts. So, the number in the quantity field must be a multiple of six.

##### Tradovate Commission & Instruments

Effective management of commissions and trading instruments is essential for success on the Tradovate platform. Below is a comprehensive guide to understanding how commissions work and the instruments available for trading.
Commissions for Tradovate
Tradovate’s commission structure is designed to be straightforward and cost-effective, but traders need to stay informed about its mechanics and updates.
How Commissions Are Deducted
Commissions are automatically deducted from your account balance at the time of the trade. To keep track of adjustments, ensure you monitor your balance directly within Tradovate.
NinjaTrader Users
If using NinjaTrader with Tradovate or Rithmic connections, commissions may not automatically reflect in your balance. You can manually enable this by defining commission settings.
Setup Instructions
To add commission tracking in NinjaTrader when using Rithmic or Tradovate, follow the steps outlined in the instructional video provided by Apex Trader Funding. Use the "lifetime" template for accuracy.

Apex Trader Funding aims to provide traders with the lowest possible commission rates.

##### Common Questions and Troubleshooting for WealthCharts

Can WealthCharts notify me if a trade reaches my parameters?
WealthCharts has the ability to notify you via email, SMS, or in-app notification when an instrument has reached your parameters in a scanner OR if it has reached a certain price level.
Scanner and Price Alerts make trading stress-free, so set up your own conditions and get away from the computer screen so you can get back to doing the things you love!
What contract should I be trading?
Front-month contracts are determined by the highest open interest in the prior session. To find this, go to https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/products.html#sortAsc.
Once you select your product, select the Volume & OI tab. Verify that you have Futures Quote data selected and not Options Quote data. Look at the Open Interest column to see which contract month has the highest open interest—this will be the front-month contract.
Can I create and customize my own indicators?
With WealthScript, members on WealthCharts have access to a dynamic coding language to create their own custom scripts that they can use to analyze the markets.
If you are not a coder, fret not! Take advantage of WealthScript Visual Builder to drag and drop pieces together to create your masterpiece!
Can I trade on WealthCharts, or is it analysis only?
You can absolutely trade directly off of WealthCharts! You can pull up an order panel with a DOM attached, trade directly off of a chart, or utilize our options trading platform as well.

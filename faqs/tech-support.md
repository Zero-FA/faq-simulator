For day traders, every millisecond counts. Ensuring your computer runs at peak performance can make the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. Here are some helpful tips.

What are the ideal computer specifications for day trading?
To handle the demands of trading platforms, live data feeds, and charting tools, aim for the following specs:

Processor: Multi-core CPUs (e.g., Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9) with a high clock speed (3.5 GHz or higher is preferred).
RAM: At least 16GB; 32GB or more is preferable for multitasking.
Storage: SSD (Solid State Drive) for faster data access and system performance.
Graphics Card: A dedicated GPU, such as an NVIDIA GTX/RTX series, or AMD RX series, is recommended for smooth chart rendering.
Network: High-speed internet with low latency (fiber-optic is ideal). Consider using a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.

Setting Up 2FA:
You’ll be prompted to scan a QR code using an authenticator app on your phone (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator).
Download an authenticator app of your choice from your app store if you don’t already have one.
Open the app.
Select the '+' symbol on the app.
Then select 'scan the QR code' option.
Scan the QR code on your Apex Member Dashboard (image above).
The app will generate a 6-digit code.
Enter this code into the setup screen on your dashboard.

Common troubleshooting tips:
These codes are only valid for approximately 30 seconds at a time. Please ensure you are entering the correct code displayed at the time.
If you use the same authenticator app for multiple logins, please ensure you are using the code associated with your Apex login.
If you have a personal Apex user account, and a business Apex user account, you will be required to enable separate 2FA for each account. When logging in, ensure you are using the correct authenticator code for the intended Apex account (personal or business).
